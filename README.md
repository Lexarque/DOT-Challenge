This is the project that I made for a challenge. Here I made a simple transaction on a video game store, it only has 3 tables, and that is : games, carts, and users; It implements REST api architecture for the requests. 

You can see the database design on the image below, the primary key of each table is the first column of each table, each table primary key is auto incremented :
